## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Sarah Converse in the the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/qcons/" target="_blank">Quantitative Conservation Lab</a>. This wonderful group is housed in the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/wacfwru/" target="_blank">Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit</a> at the University of Washington.

I am a quantitative ecologist with interests and passions that span disciplines and ecosystems. While I am broadly interested in understanding how factors (natural and anthropogenic) impact wildlife populations, I am particularly concerned with how this knowledge can lead to better species management and conservation. I study a variety of systems and questions, all unified by the use of population demographic models to allow for better resolution of the underlying ecological processes at work. My interests vary from species biogeography and community ecology to optimizing invasive species management. 

I am also committed to revolutionizing myself, my field, and my institutions in order to become actively anti-racist and create just and equitable spaces for all who wish to participate and collaborate in knowledge production. I believe that meaningful and effective research, learning, and mentoring is integrally tied to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI).
